# Hi there!

My name Roberto Sequeira. I'm a Software Engineer located in CR currently working at [LTVCo](https://github.com/ltvco).

I love software development because everyday I face new challenges and problems to solve. In my opinion, this is a great opportunity to continuously learn and grow.

Constant change requires adaptability and this is why, aside from a development language, I think learning, good practices and strong foundations are key elements to deliver successful projects.
